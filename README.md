# DistributedH2OSimulation

This is a project for STDISCM which demonstrates hydrogen and oxygen bonding.

## Group Members
- Dalisay, Andres
- Llamado, Jon
- Salvador, Bryce

## Details & Options
- If running using three separate machines, run each project (DistributedH20Simulation-Server, DistributedH20Simulation-HClient, DistributedH20Simulation-OClient) on each machine. Make sure that each machine is connected to the same network and is discoverable.
- Set the `MASTER_SERVER_IP` in both the HClient and OClient to the IPv4 address of the machine running the DistributedH20Simulation-Server.

## Disclaimer
- Currently, the project can only run once. If you want to run the project again, you have to restart all three projects.
